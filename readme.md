# Appmonitor Schema

Json schema definitions for all json data of app-monitor. The schema is supposed
to aid at developing tools around it.

It should be noted that the authors don't hold any authority over the software
and that it is based on the documentation. So the schema might be incorrect.

# Uses

The schema's can be used for code generation.

The schemas get generated from typescript code, which helps js development as
well.

# Status

The schema is currently incomplete.

# Build

To generate the json schema's in `/schema` run:

```
npm run build
```
